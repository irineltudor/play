                </h2>
                <p>
                    Grand Theft Auto V (also known as Grand Theft Auto Five, GTA 5, GTA V, or GTAV) is a video game developed by Rockstar North. It is the fifteenth installment in the Grand Theft Auto series and the successor of Grand Theft Auto IV. The original edition was released on September 17th, 2013 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions were released on November 18th, 2014, and was later released on April 14th, 2015 for the PC. 
                    A further enhanced version for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X was announced in 2020, and is expected to release in fall of 2021. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The original edition was announced on October 25th, 2011; the game's first trailer was released on November 2nd, 2011, at 4:00 PM GMT. 
                    The game was initially slated for a Spring 2013 release and there were even posters printed saying this but was delayed until September 17th the same year. 
                    Then, on July 15th, 2013, Rockstar announced the Japanese release date for the game: October 10th, 2013, almost a month after it was released in the Western world.
                    The enhanced edition was announced on June 9th, 2014, with pre-orders made available on June 10.

                    Grand Theft Auto V is set circa 2013 in the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas and tells the stories of three protagonists: Michael De Santa, Franklin Clinton, and Trevor Philips. 
                    It takes place about five years after the events of Grand Theft Auto IV, and four years after the events of Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars. 
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    As one of the most awaited video game titles to be released in 2013, the game was widely anticipated prior to its release. Grand Theft Auto V was released to universal acclaim, holding scores of 96 and above on MetaCritic and GameRankings, as well as receiving perfect scores from over 30 reviewers. 
                    The game sold 11,210,000 copies and grossed $800,000,000 on its first day of release, setting many records, and eventually making $1,000,000,000 within 3 days of the game's release.

                <h2>
                    Gameplay:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Grand Theft Auto V evolves nearly every mechanic that was in the previous Grand Theft Auto games. 
                    As far as driving goes, the vehicles have been greatly improved, with Rockstar running more complex physics on them, such as making some cars hold to the ground slightly better. 
                    The driving mechanics feel more like a racing game, particularly the Midnight Club series, compared to Grand Theft Auto IV's rocky, boat-like handling system. 
                    The shooting mechanics are better in terms of the feel of the mechanics and larger compared to the melee mechanics in the game, that being said, melee has been improved over the previous titles as well. Weapon selection has now also been changed. Instead of the old way of selecting through all the weapons sequentially, there is now a Weapon Wheel, which is similar to the one featured in Red Dead Redemption, another game made by Rockstar Games. 
                    Grand Theft Auto V draws inspirations from many different Rockstar titles in the past, including Max Payne 3, Midnight Club, Manhunt, and Red Dead Redemption. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many unique features in the game; one being that when the players are playing as one of three protagonists in the game, the other two are living their independent daily lives, and the player may be surprised by what they find the characters doing when they switch back into them. 
                    Another unique feature is that the character swapping feature is executed in a Google Earth-styled manner and was displayed during a Game Informer demo, which was shown to have run smoothly and without lag. The PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions present an exclusive feature, the first-person mode, where the whole game can be played through the eyes of the protagonist. 
                    This gameplay mode presents a whole new way to play the game. 
                    Cars have detailed interiors different from one another; shooting is like that of a dedicated FPS game. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    New activities have been added, such as yoga, triathlons, jet skiing, parachuting, tennis, golf, and scuba diving. 
                    Random events have also been added to the game and can appear anytime as the player explores around the map. 
                    The mobile phone has returned from Grand Theft Auto IV but is now only used for calling the player's contacts, surfing the web, and quick saving. 
                    Giving people the middle finger is another new feature the player can use while in a vehicle. Rockstar recommended that the player do this in various locations around Los Santos to see the outcome; depending on where the player is at, they will get varied reactions from pedestrians.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rockstar has also made changes to the pedestrian mechanics; some pedestrians can be seen at the bus stops in East Los Santos, and the same people can reappear in Rockford Hills working in the gardens of the opulent mansions. 
                    Some minor mechanics that help convey the environment and appearance of Los Santos occur at certain times of day, such as a sprinkler system being turned on in the morning in wealthy areas like Morningwood. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Vehicles
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Grand Theft Auto V has more vehicles than in any other Grand Theft Auto game to date, with a variety of vehicles, including aeroplanes, helicopters, cars, utility vehicles, emergency service vehicles, motorcycles, and jet skis. Players are able to fly planes, which was a cut feature from Grand Theft Auto IV because of the limited size of the map, but the feature is now available in Grand Theft Auto V because of the much larger, open world map. 
                    There are also submarines that players are able to use to explore the depths of the Pacific Ocean. The Rhino from previous GTA titles has returned, including a new complex aiming system and a realistic depiction of a tank. 
                    A new feature also allows the player to roll-over a vehicle when the car is flipped upside down. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like all previous games, a wide array of vehicles spawn driving around the map that can be stolen. To give the game a sense of realism and make the map feel more alive, various vehicles (as well as pedestrians) spawn in scenarios to make them more interactive with the map, such as delivery vans pulling out of alleyways, emergency vehicles responding, or vehicles pulling in and out of driveways. 
                    This behaviour was present in GTA IV to a lesser extent and is revamped in GTA V, even more so with the enhanced release of the game, where modified vehicles can spawn driving around, as well as the presence of the fully-controllable Jet, among other planes flying high above San Andreas. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Weapons
                </h2>
               <p>
                The game features a large variety of weapons, like the Norinco Type 56-2 assault rifles with sound suppressors, mounted flashlights, olive drab polymer furniture, and side-folding stocks. There is now the option to mount attachments onto various different guns, each one affecting the performance. 
                Melee weapons like the nightstick and the golf club that weren't present in Grand Theft Auto IV have also been introduced to Grand Theft Auto V.  
               </p>
                <h2>
                    Character Customization
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the game, the player has the option to customize the three protagonists' wardrobe and appearance. 
                    There is less customisation available compared to that of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (e.g. changing the body mass of the 3 characters isn't available as it was with Carl Johnson in San Andreas). 
                    The availability of tattoo parlours, barber shops and the ability to apply and remove facial hair has returned from GTA San Andreas after being missing from previous titles in the HD Universe. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Grand Theft Auto Online
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Grand Theft Auto Online is a multiplayer game title included in the retail copy of Grand Theft Auto V. 
                    In Grand Theft Auto Online, the player will have the freedom to explore alone or with friends, work cooperatively to complete missions, band together to participate in activities and ambient events, or compete in traditional game modes with the entire community. 
                    The game shares some achievements and mechanics originally from GTA V. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In GTA Online, multiplayer crews from Max Payne 3 can be carried over to GTA Online. GTA Online has multiplayer features linked to Rockstar's Social Club. 
                    It holds up to sixteen people on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and thirty players on the Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC versions. 
                </p>
                <P>
                    Access to Grand Theft Auto Online is free with every retail copy of Grand Theft Auto V.
