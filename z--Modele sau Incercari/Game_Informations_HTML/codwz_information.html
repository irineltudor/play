                    Description:
                </h2>
                <p>

Warzone is also a component of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. The game features two main modes, a Battle Royale mode and a Plunder mode.  
                     
                </p>
                <p>
                    Announced on March 9th, 2020, Call of Duty: Warzone was released the next day on March 10th. 
                    Warzone was downloaded and played by more than 6 million players in 24 hours, 15 million after 3 days, 30 million after 10 days , 50 million after a month, 60 million after less than two months, over 75 million after five months, and over 85 million after nine months.

                <h3>
                    Health
                </h3>
            
                <p>
                    Players start with 100 health and 2 Armor Plates equipped. Each plate adds 50 extra health. If a player equips another Armor Plate, up to a total of 3 plates, their health raises to its maximum, 250. Players can hold 5 plates in reserve at a time, or 8 if carrying an Armor Satchel, in addition to the armor they are wearing, making for a total of 8-11. Armor Plates can be purchased at Buy Stations in a bundle of 5, as well as an Armor Box which when placed can instantly fill the player's Armor Plate reserves.

                    Weapon Tiers
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Warzone consists of Weapon Tiers that can be found by looting and completing Contracts. Unlike other battle royale games where a weapon's rarity level determines its damage, fire rate, accuracy, etc, rarity tiers in Warzone simply apply more attachments to a weapon as the rarity increases.

                    Contracts
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Contracts are optional objectives that teams can complete to earn XP and Weapon XP as well as rare loot or Cash, which can be spent at Buy Stations. 
                </p>
                <ul class="b">
                    <li>
                        A Bounty contract tasks the team with killing a specific player, who is marked by a yellow circle revealing their approximate position on the map. When a player is marked as a bounty target, they and their team can see a bar on their heads-up display that measures the proximity of their hunters to the target.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A Recon contract will have the team capture a set point in the map by standing near it, similar to a point in Domination. Completing the contract will give the team one circle peek. Doing more Recon contracts can give additional circle peeks, until the final circle is revealed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A Scavenger contract will mark 3 Supply Boxes located near the player's location, one at a time, and task the team with looting each in a limited time. An Armor Satchel is guaranteed in the final supply box.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A Most Wanted contract marks its user for all enemies to see, offering a reward to any player who can eliminate them in a limited time. Letting the time run out completes the contract, rewarding the player and their team with Cash as well as redeploying any eliminated teammates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A Supply Run contract will have the team travel to a marked Buy Station approximately 500m away in a limited time. Upon completion, each team member will be able to purchase one discounted item, or get a Self Revive Kit or revive a teammate for free.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A Detection contract will replace the player's tactical equipment with a Geiger counter, which is used to locate a Radioactive Cache. Opening this special Supply Box will guarantee an RC-XD to drop. Currently, this contract is only available when playing Battle Royale Practice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A Contraband contract has a small chance of occurring after completing any of the aforementioned contracts. Among the loot the team is rewarded with, Contraband will spawn, appearing as a bright blue suitcase. It must be picked up and brought to a highlighted point for helicopter extraction within a time limit. This contract rewards the team with an unlock for one of many unique weapon blueprints.

                <p>
                    The playzone in Warzone is surrounded by toxic gas that bypasses armor plates and reduces health directly, chipping away at both. To become invincible to the gas for a certain time, players can find a Gas Mask in Supply Boxes randomly within the map or can purchase one from a Buy Station. Gas Masks can protect players from the gas for 10 seconds. After that, depending on its phase, the gas can kill a player at full health and armor in 15 seconds.
