                    Description:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was announced by publisher Electronic Arts to be released for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on November 8, 2019. 
                    An earlier 10-hour trial release date of November 5, 2019 was outlined alongside the reveal for EA Access through PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, as well as Origin Access for PC on the same date.
                    Those with an Origin Access Premier subscription for PC can play the full Deluxe Edition release of Need for Speed: Heat, which was made available on November 5, 2019. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The name of the 2019 game was revealed on August 14, 2019 with a reveal trailer showing the setting, a contrast of legitimate and illegal racing, the presence of police, and unique player avatars. 
                    The official Need for Speed website was also updated with a second countdown timer, which ended on August 19, 2019 at 8pm (BST) / 12pm (PDT) / 7pm (UTC), and concluded with the release of a gameplay trailer during the Gamescom Opening Night Live event. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the reveal of Need for Speed: Heat, an Under The Hood article was posted to the r/needforspeed subreddit by F8RGE; the Global Community Engagement Manager at Electronic Arts. 
                    The post highlights aspects unique to Need for Speed: Heat, and that the game does not feature any loot boxes, which appeared as Shipments in Ghost's previous game; Need for Speed: Payback. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It marked the series' 25th anniversary, following the first game's release in 1994 - Road & Track Presents: The Need for Speed - and the second game denoting the series' long history following the Black Edition of Need for Speed: Most Wanted; released in 2005 to mark the series' 10th anniversary.

                <h2>
                    Story
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The story follows the player participating in the Speedhunters Showdown, an organised racing event held on the streets and surrounding countryside of Palm City. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As they participate in more events at the Speedhunters Showdown, they attract the attention of Lieutenant Mercer; the leader of a task force within the PCPD. 
                    The player eventually becomes a target for the task force, alongside them becoming an influential participant of the Speedhunters Showdown. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The player ascends through the Speedhunters Showdown, earning bank and fame for their legitimate racing; and through the Palm City underground racing scene, earning a reputation and notoriety for their illegal street racing. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Campaign
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Campaign missions are story centred events that occur as the player proceeds through the Speedhunters Showdown and as they reach higher Rep Levels racing at night.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Driving Stories
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Driving Stories are side-story centred events that are unlocked alongside campaign missions, but focus on characters outside of the main narrative. They can appear during the day or night, and reward rep as well as bank. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Gameplay:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The career allows players to take a role of their own avatar in Palm City, a fictional representation of the Southeastern United States, with Miami, Florida taking precedence, and that they can participate in various forms of racing. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    AllDrive
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Players will join an AllDrive session - which can be played offline - with an AllDrive session's server including up to 16 players, as well as allowing those players to transition between day and night as those instances are sharded from each other within an AllDrive session. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players can invite others to join their party, with up to 8 players in a party within a single AllDrive session. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players can participate in pursuits together in freeroam by being in proximity of each other and the PCPD.
                    Invites can be sent server-wide or to the player's current party by pulling up to an event and sending the desired invite through an onscreen prompt. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Events
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The event types available are offered during both day and night, with the rewards offered differing between the two time periods. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the day, players earn bank from participating in events hosted by the Speedhunters Showdown. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the night, players earn rep from participating in illicit street racing events and engaging with the PCPD. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each event has a recommended performance level and optimal handling profile before entering as well as an Autolog recommendation from either a friend or a rival.
                     Players can also swap their vehicle before entering an event.

                <h3>
                    Pursuit
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Pursuits in Palm City can take place during day or night, but the PCPD's response to a pursuit differs depending on the time period. Players earn rep from participating in pursuits, with great amounts offered during night than day. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Day time pursuits limit the PCPD's available tactics, their ability to escalate a pursuit, and their options for apprehending a street racer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Night time is handled by a task force lead by Lieutenant Mercer and is funded by the PCPD. The tactics, resources, and options utilised by the task force is not limited, with Lt. Mercer authorising any force required, as they're not held to the same discretion as their day time patrolling officers. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Police will not intervene with a sanctioned day event, but will step in to any night time events, and will continue to pursue any street racers after the event has ended. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both players and PCPD units have a strength bar, which will indicate the structural integrity of their vehicle. Any vehicle that completely depletes their strength bar will 'wreck'; wrecked police units will leave a pursuit, but a wrecked player will be busted. 
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Heat Levels
                </h4>
                <p>
                    A heat level represents the pursuit condition a street racer's vehicle should be treated with; 1 being the lowest engagement and 5 being the highest engagement. Each heat level also equates to the amount a player's earned rep for a current night session will be multiplied by, should they successfully reach a safehouse or garage. 
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Cooldown
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Escaping a pursuit will trigger a cooldown state, in which the player has to elude the police long enough for a pursuit to disband. Evading a pursuit during the day will reset a player's heat level, although at night the player's car will retain their current heat level. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Evading a pursuit will allow the player to successfully complete their night session by entering either a safehouse or an owned garage. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While escaping means that a player is no longer being pursued by the PCPD, it does not mean they have be awarded their earned rep. Their earned rep isn't awarded to them until they reach a safehouse or owned garage, which will also end their current night session. 
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Busted
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Busted is when a player has been pinned by PCPD units for a certain amount of time, is completely immobilised during a pursuit, or has depleted their strength bar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being busted will reward the player with any rep they have earned during the current night session, but will not be multiplied based on their heat level. They will also have to pay a fine using bank. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players busted by the PCPD will not have an impound strike applied to their vehicle or any other form of marks that would result in them losing their vehicle. They will only be fined and have their current night session consequently concluded.
