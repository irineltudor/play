                <h2>
                    Description:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Crew 2 is first and foremost a racing game, the same as its predecessor. 
                    In this game, the player assumes the persona of an unknown racer whose goal it is to become a champion in the United States. 
                    There is also the expected emphasis on multiplayer. 
                    In co-op, players can join different rally raid events together, as well as compete in street, boat, and plane races.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Crew 2 features multiple vehicles including cars, but expands into other types including planes, motorcycles, and boats. 
                    Each vehicle type has its own physics and controls, making them unique in their gameplay. 
                    Players can switch between the vehicle types quickly and easily using the game's "Fast Fav" feature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are hub worlds and Motorsports Families, each with its own theme. These include street racing, off-road, pro racing, and freestyle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Customization
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to Status progression, players are also able to upgrade their vehicles. 
                    All vehicles have a specific Performance Level and belong to a category (dictated by the discipline).
                </p>

                <p>As such, they can buy several variations of the same vehicle model: for example, in its Street Race form, in its Touring form, and in its Rally Raid form (providing all those exist for the same model).</p>

                <p>Players can then equip various types of parts to fine-tune the performances of vehicles, according to different parameters. Examples include the vehicleâ€™s engine, transmission, exhaust, ECU, and many others.</p>

                <p>Currently, there are five levels of part rarity: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic and Legendary (added in the Gator Rush update). The rarer the parts, the more they will enhance the performance of the vehicle once equipped. </p>

                <h2>
                    Gameplay:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Similar to its predecessor, The Crew 2 is a racing game. 
                    In the game, players assume control of a racer, who is trying to work their way to become successful in multiple disciplines.
                    It features a persistent open world environment for racing and free-roaming across a scaled-down recreation of the contiguous United States.
                    In addition to cars, players can control other kinds of vehicles, including airplanes, motorcycles, and powerboats. 
                    Each vehicle has its own control physics, meaning that game play is different when players are controlling different types of vehicles.
                    Players can switch between controlling air, land and sea vehicles instantly.
                    The game features four different hub worlds, with each having their own theme and playstyle.
                    These themes include off-road, street racing, pro racing, and free-style. Similar to the first will place a huge emphasis on multiplayer.
                    It also features a cooperative multiplayer mode, which allows players to join any events besides "boss" events together. 
                    This mode can also be played solo with artificial intelligence.
                    As with the previous title, The Crew 2 requires a constant internet connection to play. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Synopsis:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game features a nonlinear story, that follows the unnamed player character as they go to become a racing icon in the United States by winning in all racing disciplines available in the game.
                    There are four disciplines: Street Racing, Off Road, Freestyle and Pro Racing. 
                    In Street Racing, the player is assisted by Latrell Jordan. In Off Road, the player is assisted by Tucker "Tuck" Morgan.
                    In Freestyle, the player is assisted by Sofia Valentina Herrera and her father, Emmett Lee Parker. 
                    In Pro Racing, the player is assisted by Alexis Kendrick.
