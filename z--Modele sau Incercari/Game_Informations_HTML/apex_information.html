                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apex Legends is a free-to-play first-person shooter battle royale video game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. 
                    The game was announced on February 3, 2019, and unveiled and released for free on the following day. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game is a part of the Titanfall universe. 
                </p>
                <h2 class ="Gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
                <p>
                    Apex Legends is a first-person shooter, as the previous mainline games in the Titanfall series. 
                    Unlike the previous games, however, Apex Legends is an ongoing live service game with no single-player campaign or traditional multiplayer matchmaking. 
                    The game is a "hero shooter," where players play as discrete, individualized characters with their own designs, personalities, stories and special abilities. 
                    The primary format of the game is a "battle royale," where players airdrop onto a remote island with no supplies on their person; they must scavenge equipment from the environment and fight against others in an ever-shrinking free-for-all battlefield, with the winner being the last man standing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players play as "Legends", hero characters similar to the Pilot or Titan classes found in Titanfall 2.
                    Standard matches in Apex Legends are played in squads of three, fighting against nineteen other squads for a total of twenty squads - 60 players - in any given match. 
                    The winners - the game's Apex Champions - are the last squad standing after all other squads are eliminated. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Legends
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before a game begins, the three members of the squad are placed in random order and given a few seconds apiece to pick their Legend for the game; Legend choice within the squad is first-come-first-serve, and duplicate Legends are not allowed (two teammates cannot pick the same character). 
                    The last player to pick their Legend is the designated "Jumpmaster," who ultimately decides where and when the fireteam drops onto the map as a single unit, though they can pass the role onto another player during the drop phase.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All competitors begin a match with no equipment on their person, special abilities aside. 
                    They must scavenge the field for weapons and ammunition, gear, ordnance and consumables. 
                    Items are laid out randomly across the map, so no two-item spawns will ever be the same between matches; that said, certain regions of the map are designated by what certain rarities of equipment they are likely to contain. Most items can be found lying out in the open, in supply bins, or in the rare Loot Tick hidden around the map. A couple of exceptional items, notably the gold-quality Kraber, Peacekeeper, and Prowler can only be initially found in a random supply drop. Items can also be scavenged from a defeated competitor's "death box," the remains of their inventory from the moment they were eliminated; a death box will glow the color of the highest rarity item in that box.
                    All deathboxes disappear if there is nothing left in them and have no respawn banner. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Weapons
                </h2>
               <p>
                There are currently 24 available weapons for the players to find and use, 19 at launch, with more planned to be added in the future. 
                Most of the weapons make a reappearance from previous Titanfall games, while some of them are upgraded versions of older weapons or new ones in general. There are six available classes of weapon type: assault rifles, submachine guns, light machine guns, sniper rifles, shotguns, and pistols. 
                They are also generally organized by what ammo type they use (light ammo, heavy ammo, energy ammo, shotgun shells or sniper rounds). 
                Weapons can be cosmetically customized with their own skins a player chooses outside of the game; picking up another player's weapon lets you see the customization they use on their weapon if any.   
               </p>
               <p>
                Nearly all weapons can be modified on the fly with attachments, pieces of kit discovered in the field to improve a gun's functionality. 
                These mods include barrels to reduce muzzle rise and at level 4 flash, stocks to shorten transition from one weapon to the next, larger magazines to increase ammo capacity, scopes to improve a gun's iron sights capability, and Hop-Ups which can change handling of a weapon in some way. 
                When swapping a weapon for another found in the field, the game will show which mods, if any, will carry over to the new weapon. 
               </p>
                <h2>
                    Armour and Health
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Any given Legend's special abilities aside, there are three types of armour a player can find and equip: body armour, a helmet, and a knockdown shield. 
                    Body armour improves your character's overall health and guards against damage. A helmet provides protection against headshots. 
                    A knockdown shield is used when a character is downed, letting them put up a small shield to provide forward protection against incoming damage while they crawl to safety. 
                    All three armour types come in varying levels of quality, with higher quality armor providing greater levels of protection. 
                    Body armour - even when fully depleted - can be restored by using shield cells of assorted sizes, though this takes time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When taking damage, damage applies to armor first. When the armor is fully depleted, characters take damage directly to their health. Health can be recovered with syringes or medkits scavenged from the field, or certain abilities a character may have, though this takes time. 
                    Like most battle royales, when a character takes enough damage, they are "downed" or "knocked down," leaving them crawling on the ground and mostly defenceless; if a teammate is still standing, they can pick up their downed teammate with a revival move and get them back into the fight with limited health (if a character is carrying a particular gold-quality knockdown shield, they can use its special ability to pick themselves up, though this takes longer). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a downed character takes enough additional damage, they are "dead" and out of play. However, unlike most other battle royales, death is not necessarily the end. If a character is killed and a teammate is still active, they have 90 seconds to get to the killed character's death box (the remains of their inventory) and recover their banner. Once a banner is recovered, the surviving teammate(s) can travel to a respawn beacon and use the banner. 
                    If successful, the dead character will be fully revived and return to the fight on that respawn beacon via dropship, albeit with an empty inventory. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If all members of a squad are downed or killed at the same time, the squad is eliminated from the game, meaning their game is over entirely. 
                    The members can either spectate other players still in the game or exit the game and return to the main menu to start over. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inventory
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Players have limited inventory with which to carry any items or equipment scavenged from the field. 
                    A character can only carry up to two weapons at a time, each weapon with its own aforementioned set of modifications it can equip. 
                    They have one designated slot apiece for a helmet, body armour, knockdown shield and backpack - the latter expands their inventory by providing additional inventory slots. 
                    As mentioned previously, the aforementioned equipment types come in varying quality, with higher quality gear providing improved protection or carrying capacity, and the rarest gold-level equipment providing not only the best protection/capacity but also exclusive special abilities. Their inventory consists of discrete slots with which they can carry other miscellaneous items, like syringes and medkits, shield cells, various ammunition types, ordnance, and unequipped weapon mods. They cannot carry spare weapons or duplicate pieces of armour. 
                    Inventory management will be crucial to success, as a player will have to decide what items are more valuable to them at any given moment.
